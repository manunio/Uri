# URI

[RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) -- Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

## Example

        foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
        \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
        |           |            |            |        |
    scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
        |   _____________________|__
        / \ /                        \
        urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

## Elements

* `IsRelative` -- flag indicating whether or not the reference is `relative reference` (as opposed to a `URI`)
* `Scheme` -- scheme name, if reference isn't relative
* `UserInfo` -- user information (user name, potentially with authorization information), if any is included
* `Host` -- host name or IP address, if included
* `Port` -- port number, if included
* `HasPort` -- flag indicating whether or not to include port number
* `Path` -- sequence of strings
  * Include absolute path by making first element empty
* `Query` -- query string, if included
* `Fragment` -- fragment string, if included

### Special disambiguation rules

* `path-abempty`: For a `URI` with an `authority` component, the path must be either empty or absolute (first element empty); otherwise, it wouldn't possible to distinguish which characters belong to `host` and which belong to the path's first segment.
* `path-noscheme`: A `relative reference` cannot have a path whose first segment contains a colon (`:`) character; otherwise, its string representation would be ambiguous: it would also match a `URI` whose `scheme` is the part of the first segment of the path before the colon).

### Notes

* An empty string property indicates that it isn't included in the reference.
* A zero port number is still valid syntactically, so we need the separate `HasPort` property to indicate whether or not to include `Port`.
* The `authority` component is only included if `Host` is not empty, regardless of whether or not `UserInfo` is empty, and regardless of `HasPort`.
* If the first element of `Path` is an empty string, it indicates that the path is absolute.
